👋 Hello, World! I’m Pavan 🌎
Welcome to my GitHub profile—a place where bugs become features, and code becomes magic (eventually). 🚀

🧠 About Me!!
Job title? Professional Googler.
Coding style? Somewhere between “It works!” and “Why does this work?”
Superpower? Turning caffeine into poorly written comments. ☕💻
🤓 What I Do ??
I write code that sometimes does what I want it to. My specialties include:

Debugging with a mix of hope and tears.
Naming variables like thingy and doStuff.
Spending 5 hours automating something that takes 5 minutes manually.
😂 Fun Facts
I once fixed a bug by deleting the entire file. No regrets.
My favorite debugging tool? Print statements (don’t judge me).
I have 99 problems, and Git merge conflicts are all of them.
🛠️ Tools of Chaos
Editor of choice: VS Code (because it’s got pretty themes).
Keyboard shortcuts: I know one. It’s called Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.
Languages: Fluent in Python, JavaScript, and sarcasm.
🌟 Life Goals
Make my code so good, future developers don’t curse my name.
Automate something pointless but hilarious.
Convince my computer to love me back.
Feel free to stalk my repositories, clone my work, or just say hi. But please, no judging my commit messages. 😅
